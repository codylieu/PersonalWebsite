<div class="container"> <br> <br> <h1>Projects</h1> <br> <p>Most of my code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/codylieu">Github profile</a>. In my spare time, I've made:</p> <br> <ul class="list-group"> <li class="list-group-item"><b>This website</b> using AngularJS/Javascript, HTML5/CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, Yeoman, and Heroku. I've been meaning to see how convenient Yeoman can be for scaffolding projects and wanted to brush up on my web development. What better way to do both than with a personal website! I didn't really need AngularJS, but I figured I'd include it since I may want to integrate it with my other projects or add dynamic content down the line.</li> <li class="list-group-item"><b>My Gains: A One Rep Max Calculator for Powerlifters</b> using AngularJS/Javscript and Yeoman. As a powerlifter, I find that a lot of my motivation comes from quantifiable as opposed to qualitative progress. Therefore, I made this so I can have a clear metric of my progress and stay motivated towards my goals. I'm in the process of expanding this to include user sign in and storing of workout sessions as well as displaying charts and graphs on metrics and progress using the D3.js visualization library.</li> </ul> </div>
