<div class="container"> <br> <br> <h1>About Me</h1> <br> <p>Hey! My name is Cody and I'm a junior at Duke University majoring in Computer Science and Math with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I recently had the most transformative summer of my life interning at Guidewire Software in Foster City, CA. There, I not only grew immensely as a Software Engineer, participating in many aspects of the Software Development life cycle, but also as a person, realizing what my priorities and passions are and how to best pursue them. In the course of just 3 months, I discovered how much I loved working with and learning from the driven and smart, yet chill and fun people that characterize the Norcal tech industry. I already can't picture myself spending my formative professional years anywhere else and cannot express how excited I am to contribute to this truly unique industry with my own code footprint. My current interests lie primarily in web development where I've used cool technologies like HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS/Javascript, MongoDB, Twitter Bootstrap, and Java</p> <p>At Duke, I am a brother of the Duke Associate Chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon, Director of Expansion for the Multicultural Greek Council, and a member of Duke Chinese Dance (Duke's largest student organization). Outside of Duke, I keep up with male fashion, occasionally binge watch anime, and have made it my goal as a Boba connoisseur to try every Bubble Tea place in the Bay Area. I also participate in Powerlifting and Olympic Lifting and hope to set a Maryland state record before I'm 23 (i.e. before the Genetic Monsters start taking over in the adult age group).</p> <p>I hope you all have enjoyed my ramblings. As a departing note, I hate photos of myself and am generally incapable of smiling correctly, so here's my usual go to expression for pictures:</p> <br> <div class="row text-center"> <img src="images/derpy.png" style="width:400px;height:400px"> </div> </div>
